# Raspifarm VS Andritz

Before rolling out the ansible bootstrap playbook, make sure that the systems
are set to the correct language. You may do this by running

```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
```

Select all relevant languages (`de-AT`, `de-DE`, `en-GB`, `en-IE` and `en-US`)
and set `de-AT` as default.
